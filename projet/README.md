### Struggles

We had difficulties to use Github. We didn't understood well the features (Pull, push, fetch and everything else).
We couldn't display our widgets on  Storybook. When we tried to, we had many errors on the terminal.
It was difficult to make this project only through telephone and Discord.
It was also difficult to manage our time with all the deadlines we had in other classes.
